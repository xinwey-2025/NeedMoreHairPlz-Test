# Guide

This is a general guide for working on projects collaboratively.

## Learning Resources
- Git
    - https://github.com/progit/progit2/releases/download/2.1.448/progit.pdf (Reading 3 chapters should be sufficient, until the chapter Git Branching)
- GitHub contributing/collaborating workflow
    - https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project
    - https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project
    - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-workflow-for-open-source/
- How to write Git commit messages

## How to Handle Bugs and Issues
- Google search the problem. We'll find oficial documentations, forums, and articles related to our issues.
- The most recommended one is **official documentation** like [this one](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html) that tells us everything we need to know about the `java.util.Random` module.
- Sometimes we'll want to look at forums because most likely we are not the only one that has this issue and someone has asked on forums already. Forums like **StackOverflow** and **Reddit** is very useful.
- Your **last resort** should be **LLMs** like ChatGPT and Gemini. Avoid using these from the start because:
    1. You'll learn A LOT less if you depend on them,
    2. They work well for small programs but suck for large projects because they don't understand the project structure well as humans can do.
    3. They can be really inaccurate. If you don't understand the code then copy paste into your IDE it's going to cause a lot of mess.
